# Business Responsive Website Theme

It is a website theme with a great responsive layout built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your business. This theme had been tested in the recent version of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera Browsers (November 2021) with a good result.

I've not used any CSS or JS framework in this project. I built it with CSS float property so this theme is more compatible with old browsers versions as well as new ones. I use Normalize.css for compatibility purposes between different browsers types.

For icons, I used Fontawesome 5 Solid and for fonts, Merriweather and Open Sans had been chosen to use. All of the images in this project have a free-to-use license, and most of them are from the Unsplash free image website from various photographers.
