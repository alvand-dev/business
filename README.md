# Business Theme

It is a responsive website template built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your business.

This theme, tested in the recent version of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera Browsers (November 2021).

I've not used any CSS or JS framework. Built with CSS float property, so it is more compatible with old browsers versions.

I use Normalize.css for compatibility purposes and Splide.js for building the gallery's slider.

I also use Fontawesome Solid, Merriweather, and Open Sans fonts.

All of the images are free to use, and most of them are from unsplash.com.
