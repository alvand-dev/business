# Business Theme

It is a website template built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your business. This theme was tested in the recent version of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera Browsers (November 2021).

I've not used any CSS or JS framework. But Responsive layout media query sizes are based on the Bootstrap 4 grid system. Built with CSS float property, so it is more compatible with old browsers versions.

I use Normalize.css for compatibility purposes and Splide.js for building the gallery's slider. I also use Fontawesome Solid, Merriweather, and Open Sans fonts. All of the images are free to use, and most of them are from unsplash.com.
