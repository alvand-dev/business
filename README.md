# Business Theme

It is a website template built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your business. Tested in the recent version of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera Browsers (November 2021).

I didnâ€™t use any CSS or JS framework. But Responsive layout media query sizes are based on the Bootstrap 4 grid system. Built with CSS float property so it is more compatible with old browser's versions.

I use Normalize.css for compatibility purposes and Splide.js for building slider. I also use Fontawesome Solid, Merriweather, and Open Sans fonts. All of the images are free to use, and most of them are from unsplash.com.
